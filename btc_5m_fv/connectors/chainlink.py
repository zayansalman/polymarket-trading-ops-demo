"""Chainlink Data Streams connector stub.

Implements ``AbstractPriceConnector`` interface but defers all operations to a
future integration (GitHub issue #9).  This stub preserves the architecture
contract so downstream components (registry, strategy, health checks) can treat
Chainlink as a first-class price source even before the integration is live.

What Chainlink Data Streams would provide
-----------------------------------------
`Chainlink Data Streams <https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/>`_ deliver
verifiable, low-latency, settlement-aware BTC/USD price updates together with a
cryptographic proof of correctness (Merkle-root attestation).  Unlike a
CEX REST feed, Data Streams are designed for on-chain settlement:

* **Cryptographic proof** — each report carries a signed merkle root that can
  be verified on-chain, eliminating the trust assumption in a single exchange.
* **Decentralised oracle network** — prices are aggregated from multiple
  premium data providers rather than a single venue.
* **Settlement trigger** — a resolved report can be pushed on-chain to trigger
  payout logic, which is relevant if the bot ever moves from paper trading to
  on-chain binary options.
* **Stream vs REST** — the production implementation would likely use the
  WebSocket stream for real-time ticks and the REST API for historical /
  reference-price lookups.

When this stub is replaced, the real implementation will:
1. Open a WebSocket connection to ``wss://<router>.ws.chain.link``.
2. Subscribe to the BTC/USD CEX Price Streams feed (stream ID TBD).
3. Decode each ``FullReport`` or ``BenchmarkPrice`` payload.
4. Verify the on-chain report signature (optional, depending on trust model).
5. Return the decoded ``benchmarkPrice`` as ``float``.
